# 3D Tic Tac Toe
version 0.1

## What It Is
3D Tic Tac Toe is a different take on the traditional game.  Players connect spaces through 3D space.

## ...But What It Is Really
I am a recent graduate of a web development immersion course.  This game is the first project and was completed after 5 weeks of the start.  See my repos for the older version of this game.

The site currently is simplistic, and hopefully I will be able to add more soon.

- A lounge for players to create and choose a game
- Allow players to watch a game in progress
- Chat functionality
- Add complexity to the game
- Implement other technologies
- ...and more!

### Limitations
Currently, this game only allows one game to run.  Visitors to the game are not allowed to watch either.

Technologies Used: HTML5/CSS3, JS, AngularJS, Firebase
