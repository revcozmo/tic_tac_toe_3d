# 3D Tic Tac Toe
version 0.1

## What It Is
3D Tic Tac Toe is a different take on the traditional game.  Players connect spaces through 3D space.

## ...But What It Is Really
I am a recent graduate of a web development immersion course.  This game is the first project and was completed after 5 weeks of the start.  See my repos for the older version of this game.

The game currently is simplistic, and the code is in need of serious refactoring.  Revisions and additions are soon to come.

- A lounge for players to create and choose a game
- Allow players to watch a game in progress
- Chat functionality
- Add complexity to the game
- Implement other technologies
- ...and more!

### Limitations
Currently, this game only allows one game to run.  Visitors to a full game are not allowed to watch either.

Technologies Used: HTML5/CSS3, JS, AngularJS, Firebase
